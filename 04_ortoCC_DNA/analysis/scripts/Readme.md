This directory contains the scripts for the major analyses in the paper.

### Figure files
Each figure file reproduces one of the figures from the main text. They require other relative directories, namely ../data, ../model_data, ../designs and should populate graphs in ../figures/figure# .
Figure files may require R v3.3.3 or higher.
Libraries which must be included are listed at the top of each figure file
