# Designing CCmax

This directory contains the code used to design the orthogonal sets for the CCmax orthogonal sets. In the code and old nodes this library is also  referred to as R16000 or R16k, because it has about 16000 pairs.

The notebooks contain the code and comments need to run. They are numbered in the order of execution (with at two digit prefix).

The notebox with 21 prefix are automatically generated over different models and combinations of scoring functions (iCipa is DNA-ALL-basicL-rep-nter_core-Ridge-WbnRD10)
