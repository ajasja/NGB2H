# This directory contains the scripts for the major analyses in the paper:

* analysis -- Preprocessing raw reads to enrichment ratios and figures.
* barcode_counting --  We take NGS reads of DNA barcodes and condense it down to just barcode counts
* barcode_mapping -- Scripts necessary to take NGS reads of proteins and barcodes and uniquely deidentify each barcode and corresponding protein pair.
* library_generation -- Creates codon optimized 230 bp oligonucleotides.
* scripts -- Helper scrips.
