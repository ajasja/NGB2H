# Fitting iCipa

This directory contains the code used to fit an improved scoring function based on the data from the CCNG1 (R8000) library.

Several linear models and fitting functions were tried. The main problem of bCipa is that all the on-target pairs were predicted to have the same binding strength, while in reality the binding strength differs. The vertical structure of the coiled coiled and the charges and helicity was used to explain this variation.

DNA-ALL-basicL-rep-nter_core-Ridge-WbnRD10 was the best model and became iCipa.

The notebooks contain the code and comments need to run. They are numbered in the order of execution (with at two digit prefix).
