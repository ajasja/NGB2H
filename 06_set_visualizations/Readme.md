# Visualization of designed sets

This directory contains visualizations and metrics on the designed sets for both CCNG1 and CCmax libraries.

The subdirectories contain an Excel file for each set in the library. The excel files contain all the on-target pairs with colored electrostatics, the number of NN, NI, and II matches or mismatches at the a position and the number of electrostatic matches and mismatches t the g and e positions. The second sheet contains details about the set as well as a heat map plot.

The HTML files are self contained interactive plots, that show the iCipa scoring function vs the melting point temperatures derived from the experimental interaction score for all the sets in the CCNG1 library. Mouse over the point to show the details (an example is shown below). The [first file](0_no_shifting_DNA-ALL-basic-rep-nter_core-Ridge-WsdRD10.plot.html) does not use heptade shifting, while the [second does](5_with_shifting_DNA-ALL-basic-rep-nter_core-Ridge-WsdRD10.plot.html).
